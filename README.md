## 🚨 Problem Statement

**Traditional security cameras are passive observers** - they record incidents after they happen, but cannot prevent them. Security personnel must constantly monitor multiple feeds, leading to:

- **Human fatigue and missed threats**
- **Delayed response times** (average 8-12 minutes)
- **High false alarm rates** (95% of security alerts are false positives)
- **Reactive security** instead of proactive threat prevention

**The cost of security incidents is staggering**: Workplace violence costs businesses $36 billion annually, while theft and vandalism add another $50 billion in losses.
